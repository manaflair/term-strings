## Installation

```
$> npm install --save @manaflair/term-strings
```

## Usage (Terminal)

```
$> term-strings --in front.red
```

The `--in` option (also available as `-i`) is implied, so you can also write:

```
$> term-strings front.rebeccapurple
```

The `--out` option (also available as `-o`) outputs the sequence required to reset the requested style.

```
$> term-strings --out front
```

The `--raw` option (also available as `-r`) prints the raw strings that follow.

```
$> term-strings --raw Hello world!
```

You can use these options multiple times, in any order:

```
$> term-strings
..   -i front.red
..     -r "Red Text"
..   -o front
..   -r " and "
..   -i front.green
..     -r "Green Text"
..   -o front
```

Finally, note that hexadecimal colors can also be printed:

```
$> term-strings front.#ff0000
```

## Usage (Node.js)

```js
import { style } from '@manaflair/term-strings';

let prefix = style.bold + style.front.rebeccapurple;
let suffix = style.bold.out + style.front.out;

console.log(`${prefix}Hello!${suffix}`);
```

Term-Strings also support truecolors if available (if not, colors will be gracefully degraded to match either 256 colors or 4-bits colors, depending on your terminal capabilities):

```js
import { style } from '@manaflair/term-strings';

let prefix = style.front(`#123456`);
let suffix = style.front.out;
```

It is advised to cache the result of the `front` and `back` functions, as calling them multiple times in a single render might become quite expensive.

## Detecting truecolors

Truecolor detection isn't currently possible without a bit of help. Thank terminfo for [refusing to implement this in their databases, and generally being a dick about it](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2016-08/msg00036.html) (they have been notified since 2013).

In order to enable truecolors, you'll need to export a `TERM_FEATURES` environment variable:

```
$> export TERM_FEATURES="true-colors:$TERM_FEATURES"
```

Note that you can also use this variable to enable the 256 colors mode (`256-colors`) or even the basic colors mode (`basic-colors`), should Term-Strings fail to recognize them.
